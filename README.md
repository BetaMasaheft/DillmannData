# Dillmann lexicon

This is the data repo for use with the [Dillmann application](https://github.com/BetaMasaheft/Dillmann) to display data from the digitization process of the *Lexicon Linguae Aethiopicae* of Augustus Dillmann. It is deployed at the moment only for registered users with the relevant data at the University of Hamburg.

Data files are validated on CI.
